### üìù ABOUT THE PROJECT

This API is intended to serve data for a future front-end project, the culmination of which will be a fully functioning website!

Users will be able to post reviews on given topics, as well as joining discussions by commenting on them. A 'vote' feature allows users to quickly show whether they liked or disliked a review. Further functionalities are already planned, including creating topics, voting on comment, and much more!

### ‚úîÔ∏è 3. DOTENV

In order for you to be able to run this project locally you will need to create 2 files in the main directory:
```programming
.env.development
.env.test
```

You can refer to the ``` .env-example ``` file to see how the files should look, however in each file you can copy and paste the relevant text below.


``` .env.development ``` should contain the following:
```
PGDATABASE=nc_games
```

and ``` .env.test ``` should contain the following:
```
PGDATABASE=nc_games_test
```

This will connect the databases. The ``` .gitignore ``` already has all ``` .env ``` files added to it for security reasons when pushing to GitHub.
