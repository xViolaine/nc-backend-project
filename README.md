## How To Connect To The Database

To connect to the database, you'll need to download the dotenv-module.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv
```
npm install dotenv --save
```

You'll then want to create a .env file in the root of your project, like so:
```
PGDATABASE=YOUR_DATABASE_HERE
```

Congratulations, you have now set up a way for your project to use environment variables in your process.env!
